# TorScraper

**TorScraper** is a specialized Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tool built with **Go (Golang)**. It automates data collection from .onion services by routing all traffic anonymously through the Tor network.

## Features

* **Full-Page Screenshot:** Captures the entire page of the .onion site as a PNG file.
* **HTML Backup:** Downloads and saves the raw source code for offline analysis.
* **Concurrent Scanning:** Uses Go's worker pool pattern to scan multiple targets at once.
* **Anonymous Routing:** All traffic is strictly routed through SOCKS5 proxy (**127.0.0.1:9150**).
* **Target Management:** Reads addresses from a `targets.yaml` file.

## Requirements

- **Go:** 1.20+ recommended
- **Tor Browser:** Connected and running on port 9150
- **Browser:** A Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Chromium, Edge, or Brave)

## Install

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Ayb3rk38/TorScraper.git](https://github.com/Ayb3rk38/TorScraper.git)
cd TorScraper 
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```
## ⚙️ Configuration

**Important:** The repository includes a template `targets.yaml` file. Before running the tool, please open the file and populate it with valid .onion URLs:

```yaml
targets:
  - [http://exampleonionaddress1.onion](http://exampleonionaddress1.onion)
  - [http://exampleonionaddress2.onion](http://exampleonionaddress2.onion)
  ```

How to Run

Run the tool from the repository root:

```bash
go run . -f targets.yaml -w 5
```

Browser Selection (Cross-Platform)

If detection fails, set CHROME_PATH to your browser executable before running.

Linux (bash/zsh)

```bash
export CHROME_PATH="/usr/bin/google-chrome"
go run . -f targets.yaml -w 5
```

macOS (zsh)

```bash
export CHROME_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
go run . -f targets.yaml -w 5
```

Windows (PowerShell)

```bash
$env:CHROME_PATH = "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
go run . -f targets.yaml -w 5
```

## Output

The tool generates the following files in the project directory:

- `screenshots/`: Full-page PNG captures of the visited sites.
- `results.json`: Structured data containing the scraped HTML and URLs.
- `scan_report.log`: Detailed log file including active/passive status.
